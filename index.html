          <h2>Welcome to <span>Sustainability Insights</span></h2>
          <p>
            A reposistory of my experiences while attempting to make our way of life more sustainable and the insights gained from the same. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the technology used today was designed to work on fossil fuels. This however, has to change for the better by being sustainable. Having an avid interest in Physics that later morphed into an interest in Engineering, I want to contribute to this so called 'revolution' by helping build technology for a greener and more prosperous future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Electrical and Electronics engineering is my immediate area of interest as the inner functions of the machines we use today could be made more sustainable in various ways. This means making today's tech more efficient, economically viable and powered by green energy. This coupled with Computer Science, something that does things at a scale and rate that humans simply can't match, would help revolutionize world and I want to be a part of it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I find <a href="https://julialang.org/" class="link-warning">Julia</a> to be a versatile language, adept at performing data analysis and at scientific computing. All work presented here 
            uses Julia, unless stated otherwise. Julia is fast and it extremely good with numbers, making it one of the most efficient languages for a host of functions.

          <p>
            As shown in the e-waste analysis section, 7% of the e waste or about 37188 kg generated would be due to notebooks. According to what I have personally learned from my experience as an Intern at <a href="http://www.eprorecyclers.com/" class="link-primary">ePro Recyclers</a>, a company that refurbishes laptops, notebooks as well as myriad other electronic devices, almost all these notebooks can be refurbished and resold at a value nearly 50% lower than the price at which it was originally sold. The total value of these notebooks when sold stands at $14,795,000. This means that approximately $7,397,500 can be retrieved annually, promoting a circular economy, if all of these notebooks are refurbished.
            Currently, 12.5% of this waste is recycled in the US. Hence, the lost value is calculated to be about $6,472,812.                  
          </p>
          <p>
            Below is a set of detailed instructions on how one could refurbish a laptop by oneself. The paraphrenalia (if any) is mentioned step-wise. All information and instructions are from my three-week long internship.

            While the refurbishing process I had learned about during my internship helped extend the life of devices, the same cannot be said about the components.              
            As the internship progressed, it became increasingly clear. Dysfunctional components were simply replaced and disposed off. While components were replaced only when found to be dysfunctional, it was a common practice to replace the battery every time. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Most batteries used in laptops and other electronics are Lithium ion batteries specifically, Lithium Cobalt Oxide batteries. As their name suggests, these batteries primarily rely on Lithium and Cobalt. While the production of Lithium is extremely water-intensive, the extraction of Cobalt from countries such as DRC is riddled with human rights issues. Thus, I was appalled when I learned that a component that is produced at such an enormous cost is simply discarded - I wanted to work on something that extended the life of batteries.

              While I was a data science intern here, I had to incorporate domain knowledge for building various solutions. I started by porting a regression model built in MATLAB, used to predit the State-of-Charge (SOC). I made the model more accessible with comparable performance by using Julia. Later, I improved the accuracy with hyperparameter tuning and open-sourced the code on Github, <a href="https://github.com/sanjaydevx/battery_tech" class="link-primary">available here</a>.
            </ul>
            <ul>
              The model used the following quantities as inputs:
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i> Voltage (measured cell terminal voltage, sense leads welded directly to battery terminal)</li>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i> Current (measure current in amps)</li>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i> Ah (measured amp-hours, with Ah counter typically reset after each charge, test, or drive cycle)</li>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i> Wh (measured watt-hours, with Wh counter reset after each charge, test, or drive cycle)</li>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i> Battery_Temp_degC (battery case temperature, at middle of battery, in degrees Celsius measured with a AD592 +/-1degC accuracy temperature sensor)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              Below are the error stats of the model after training and testing with the same datasets as the MATLAB model. The number of training epochs was 50 with 3 repetitions.

                This work earned me credibility, a ticket to intriguing work at The Enery Company. While I cannot display the further work done, I can say that it gave me experience at the forefront of innovation. It showed me how work would look like when combining domain knowledge with the power of software. Additionally, it helped me discern the benefits of using a combination of methods to develop solutions at the intersection of hardware and software. 
              </ul>

                Having said that, I look forward to using a multidimensional approach for solving problems, as effective and efficient as it is.
